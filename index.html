  <p> Climate change is a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased leves of  atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossile fuels.</p>

 <a id="second"> <h3> How did climate change start?</h3> </a>
  <p>It started for reasons like deforastation, contamiation and smoke/gases from machines , cars and more. The heat of global warming helps create more forest fires and other natural disasters. It's also due to the extreme usage of our natural resources wich some of them have gone or are starting to go scarce. </p>

  <h4> How does climate change affect people?</h4>
  <li> Contamination creates global warming</li>
  <li> Going outside is almost unbareble due to the heat</li>
  <li> The ocean leves are raising due to the Glaciers being melted by the heat, making it possible to create more catastrofic tsunamis</li>
  <li> With the heat provoking ocean levels to rise it also helps create stronguer and more distructive hurracaines and tornadoes</li>
  <li> Due to heat rising there can also be more blackouts and higher electricity bills</li>
  <li> There can be even stronger storms wich may cause difficulty for living comfortably and safe, food may also become scarce.</li>

  <h5> What can we do to reduce climate change?</h5>
  <p> There's a lot of ways to help the environment, these are a few examples. It's not too late tohelp reduce global warming, this is our planet and it's future depends on us. </p>
  <li>Cleaning our areas. Most of the contamination is due to leaving trash around on the floors and not putting them where we shoud. In other words put the trash on the trashcans. </li>
  <li> Clen any body of water to help marine life and ourselves. It helps to reduce the contamination.</li>
  <li> Recicling anything that we are able to re-use.</li>
  <li> Using less water. A four minute hower can take 20-40 gallons of water.</li>
